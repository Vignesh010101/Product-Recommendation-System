# Product-Recommendation-System
 
I implemented a robust Product Recommendation System utilizing both Collaborative Filtering and Content-Based Filtering techniques. The goal was to enhance user experience by providing personalized product suggestions.

**Key Features:**

Collaborative Filtering: Leveraged user-item interactions to identify patterns and recommend products based on user behavior and preferences.
Content-Based Filtering: Utilized product attributes and features to recommend items similar to those a user has shown interest in.

**Technologies Used:**

Python was the primary language for implementation.
Libraries and frameworks, including but not limited to:
Pandas for data manipulation.
Scikit-learn for machine learning tasks.
Collaborative filtering with Surprise library.

**Achievements:**

Successfully implemented collaborative and content-based filtering techniques.
Improved recommendation accuracy through thorough data analysis and model fine-tuning.
